# [Pixlr](https://pixlr.social/)
A Pixelart based social network.

## Description

Pixlr was developed during the [Appwrite Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-appwrite-hackathon-on-dev-1oc0) in April and May 2022 
and is published on [pixlr.social](https://pixlr.social/).

Pixlr lets users create 32x32 pixelarts and share them directly with other users. People who are logged in can comment and like post from other
users to give feedback on created art.

Pixlr is using [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) as backend and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as frontend.
