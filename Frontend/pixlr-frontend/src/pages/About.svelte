    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-justified mb-5">
        Pixlr is a social network developed by two developers that focuses on
        simple pixel art. It was created in the course of the <a
            href="https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-appwrite-hackathon-on-dev-1oc0"
            >"Appwrite Hackathon on DEV"</a
        >
        under the category "Web2 Wizards". The user interface was created using the
        web framework <a href="https://svelte.dev/">"Svelte"</a> and the CSS
        framework <a href="https://bulma.io/">"Bulma"</a>. The backend uses the
        self-hosted open-source backend server
        <a href="https://appwrite.io/">"Appwrite"</a>, which provides databases,
        user management and many other features.

                Creating posts in Pixlr is done with the help of a simply
                designed editor that provides a 32 by 32 pixel canvas for
                painting artistic masterpieces.
